! LaTeX hooks Error: Sorting rule for 'A' hook applied too late.
(hooks)              Try setting this rule earlier.
For immediate help type H <return>.
 ...                                              
l. ...\DeclareHookRule{A}{b}{after}{c}
You tried to set the ordering of hook 'A' using
  \DeclareHookRule{A}{b}{after}{c}
but hook 'A' was already used as a one-time hook, thus sorting is
no longer possible. Declare the rule before the hook is used.
